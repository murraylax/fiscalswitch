  abstract="Several proposals to reduce U.S. debt reveal large differences in their targets. We examine how an unknown debt target affects economic activity using a real business cycle model in which Bayesian households learn about a state-dependent debt target in an endogenous tax rule. Recent papers use stochastic volatility shocks to study fiscal uncertainty. In our setup, the fiscal rule is time-varying due to unknown changes in the debt target. Households infer the current debt target from a noisy tax rule and jointly estimate the transition probabilities. Three key findings emerge from our analysis: (1) limited information about the debt target amplifies the effect of tax shocks through changes in expected tax rates; (2) the welfare losses are an order of magnitude larger when both the debt target state and transition matrix are unknown than when only the debt target state is unknown to households; (3) an unknown debt target likely reduced the stimulative effect of the ARRA and uncertainty about the sunset provision in the Bush tax cuts may have slowed the recovery and led to welfare losses."

  annote="Davig and Leeper estimate a NKPC DSGE with regime switching in which fiscal and monetary policy can switch between active and passive policies.  The traditional model with active monetary policy and passive fiscal policy results in small government spending multipliers.  Government spending is crowded out with lower consumption due to the wealth effect of higher expected future taxes.  Furthermore, any stimulus resulting from government expenditures is counteracted by contractionary active monetary policy.  When they estimate the model on the full data, they find situations for other regime pairings.  They consider the multiplier effects of the ARRA under alternative represetations fiscal and monetary policy."
